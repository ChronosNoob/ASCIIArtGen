Usage is simple. You may use a direct path to a file or simply a file in the same folder as the .py file. I would reccommend the latter. You should enter if you want edgefinding and the chosen resolution. 

Using an output resolution around/above 300 can break normal notepad and it might be hard to find a text viewer that can support that size. I use notepad++ but i'm hitting the limit with that. 

Sometimes when zooming out in a text viewer the art can warp. This can be fixed by either playing around with fonts and style settings in your text viewer's settings or by taking a screenshot and manually fixing the image in some software like Photoshop or GIMP. 

The only requirement is the PIL (Pillow) library. 
This can be installed with "pip install pillow"
